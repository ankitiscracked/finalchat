        This app is my attempt to answer the question why most productivity apps
        cater poorly for power users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people working in the tech industry know that keyboard is a lot
        more faster than mouse but why the productivity apps of today don't let
        me exploit the keyboard to its full potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        So after letting this question bugging me for years, I decided to answer
        this question using the best way - build what you want to see in the
        world.
